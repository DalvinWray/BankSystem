# BankSystem
Scenario:

A local Jamaican bank is attempting to digitize a few of its services and 
operations. In an effort to have a seamless transition for their customers –
from a physical environment to an online environment. I have been
contracted to implement a section of the application and simulates some 
online banking transactions. More specifically, my application will mimic 
some operations that can be performed with a customer’s personal loan and 
savings account. An initial savings account has been sanctioned for the 
purposes of testing my implementation, using: 258647 as the main account 
number for customer Jane Doe, and 3284 as the PIN for accessing and using the 
account.
